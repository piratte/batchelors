\chapter{MongoDB explain index} \label{app:MDB}

This appendix lists output of the \texttt{db.collection.explain.find()} command applied to 
one of the queries from the testing set. The rewriting of that query can be seen in the first listing, the output
in the second one. 

\begin{minted}{sql}
SELECT FileID FROM Metas 
	WHERE testInt5.Value > 364 
	AND testStr2.Value='juliet' 
	AND testInt4.Value > 467;
\end{minted}

In the beginning the query planner writes some basic information about the search (the names \texttt{namespace},
\texttt{parsedQuery}, etc.). Then the details of the query plan selected by the optimizer are listed in name
\texttt{winningPlan}. The stage \texttt{FETCH} describes retrieving documents, in this particular case the documents
are filtered so that the constraints that are minor according to the query planer are fulfilled. Then in the next
stage \texttt{IXSCAN} the index is scanned. In this case the index over the property \texttt{testStr2} was chosen.
After the winning plan, two more rejected plans are described. These plans differ from the winning one by using a 
different index. In the end some information about the current server was printed by the command, but was not
included here because it has no relevance for this problem.
