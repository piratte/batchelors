\section{About DIRAC}
The DIRAC (Distributed Infrastructure with Remote Agent Control) project is a complete Grid solution for a 
medium-sized scientific community. DIRAC forms a layer between users and various computer resources 
to allow optimized, transparent and reliable usage. The DIRAC architecture consists of numerous 
cooperating Distributed Services and Light Agents built within the same DISET framework following 
the Grid security standards. Apart from the efficient Workload Management Systems, which introduced
the now widely used concept of Pilot Agent, DIRAC also offers a versatile Data Management System (DMS) 
optimized for reliable data transfers.
